Statistical foundations of machine learning <br />
(5 ECTS: Theory : 24h, Exercises : 12h) <br />

- Pr. G. Bontempi  

Course objectives:

Statistical machine learning is the discipline, which aims at extracting knowledge and inferring predictive models from observed data. The course will focus on the statistical notions (like bias, variance, regression, validation), which are necessary to create, identify and assess a predictive model. This course aims to find a good balance between theory and practice by situating most of the theoretical notions in a real context with the help of illustrative case studies (from biology, finance, medicine) and real datasets.

Prerequisites: course on statistics and probability and programming skills
